This file aims to document the expected syntax of the commands highlighted by this package.

Values enclosed in `<>` represent a different set of rules, which should be defined elsewhere in this file. E.g., in`\begin{tikzpicture}[<options>]`, `<options>` represents a set of rules under the heading `options`.

## TikZ

```latex
\begin{tikzpicture}[<options>]
  <environment contents>
\end{tikzpicture}
```
